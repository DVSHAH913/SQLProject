# SQL Projects

In my second semester, I embarked on an Oracle SQL project that delved into the intricacies of stock brokerage operations. The project focused on capturing real-time front-office transactions and efficiently managing the corresponding database in the back office. The comprehensive database design encompassed vital client details, share scripts, and transaction records. Leveraging the capabilities of SQL queries, I meticulously developed five essential accounting reports, widely employed by stock brokers for insightful analysis of the accumulated data.

## Overview of the Reports:

- **Report 1:** Client-wise gross purchases within a specified date range.
- **Report 2:** Client-wise purchase sales within a specified date range.
- **Report 3:** Daily transactions categorized by dates.
- **Report 4:** Script-wise sales and purchases within a date range, including customer names.
- **Report 5:** Script-wise gross sales and purchases within a specified range of dates.

This compilation serves as a testament to my proficiency in data management and analysis, showcasing my ability to translate complex financial data into meaningful insights.
